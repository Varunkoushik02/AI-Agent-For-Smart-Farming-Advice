**AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice**

This project, **AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice**, aims to support small and marginal farmers by providing them with accurate, timely, and localized agricultural guidance through a conversational AI system. The agent is built using **IBM Watsonx** and designed to understand natural language queries from farmers and respond with region-specific advice on crop selection, soil treatment, fertilizer usage, pest control, and market trends. It leverages real-time weather data, soil conditions, and agricultural knowledge bases to enhance decision-making, reduce crop failure, and promote sustainable farming practices. The system ensures ease of use, even in rural and low-connectivity areas, through a simple chat-based interface with multilingual support.
